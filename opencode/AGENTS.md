# Responding to questions
When the user asks questions like "why", "what", "how", or any other informational question, treat it as a request for explanation or information. Do not interpret these questions as indirect requests to modify code or make changes. The user wants to understand reasons, decisions, and context - simply provide clear answers and explanations without making any modifications unless explicitly requested.
